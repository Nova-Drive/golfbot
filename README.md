Golfbot: My solution for always getting the time I want.

I use Selenium in python to open a browser that automatically enter login details, select desired tee time details, and automatically select the tee time when the new times are added for the day.

Steps:

1. Add file named login.txt with line 1 being username and line 2 being password
2. Set the login time, start time, and desired tee time
3. Run program

Note: I made this for myself, and as such anyone who uses this will need to change all xpaths 
to what they need.
